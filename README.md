# Three-Tier Web Application with Docker

This repository contains a **three-tier web application** built using Docker and Docker Compose. It demonstrates a modular and production-aware architecture, separating concerns into three main services:

- **Frontend (Nginx)**: Serves static content and acts as a reverse proxy.
- **Backend (e.g., PHP-FPM/WordPress)**: Handles dynamic content and application logic.
- **Database (MariaDB)**: Manages persistent data storage.

I included a sample Secrets folder. 

### Prerequisites

```

2. Create your .env file based on the sample:
